# Execution time: 117.22 seconds
# Model used: gpt-5-mini

# Issues / Assumptions:
# - The ontology does not include a specific "Crew" class or a property to represent a process type (e.g., sequential vs parallel). I represent the crew as a :Team and store the process ("sequential") as a config key on the team's system config.
# - There is no property to model an agent's "backstory" explicitly; I represent backstories as :Prompt instances and/or agent config entries.
# - The ontology does not have explicit constructs for software-specific constructs (e.g., pydantic model types, Python method names like kickoff/train, or SDK/tool endpoints). I modeled the Pydantic output type (ResearchRoleRequirements) as a beam:SemanticModel and as a KnowledgeBase description. Training/kickoff behaviour is noted in comments only (config entries), not modelled as executable behavior.
# - Tool implementation details (e.g., network endpoints, Python classes) and code-level behaviour (e.g., Agent.train(n_iterations)) are not expressible with the existing schema and were therefore captured as literal config values or descriptions where appropriate.
# - Placeholders in task descriptions (e.g., {company_domain}) are preserved as literal promptInputData values. The ontology lacks a formal template-binding mechanism; these are stored as strings.
# - No new classes or properties were added. All items are expressed using existing classes and properties only.
