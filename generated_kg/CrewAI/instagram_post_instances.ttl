# Execution time: 218.00 seconds
# Model used: gpt-5-mini

# Issues / Assumptions:
# - The ontology does not include a dedicated property for an agent "backstory". I store backstory text using dct:description on the agent and/or agent-level Prompt instances.
# - There is no boolean property to represent Agent.allow_delegation or Agent.verbose; these runtime control flags are captured as literal annotations in agent-level Prompt/dct:description for fidelity.
# - The ontology lacks explicit properties to model "tool functions" (callable methods). I represent tools as :Tool individuals and store the semantic/purpose of each function in rdfs:comment and in associated Prompt or Config literals.
# - The ontology does not provide a property to directly represent Task parameters (function arguments). I preserved the parameter values and bindings (e.g., product_website, product_details, copy) as Prompt.promptInputData literals and as dc:description on Task individuals.
# - The ontology has no property to encode "allow_delegation" semantics of Agents nor the "verbose" flag. These are listed in agent dct:description and agent Prompt promptContext.
# - The ontology does not contain explicit "crew kickoff" or runtime orchestration semantics. Those execution semantics are not modeled; outputs are represented as produced Resource instances and linkages between Tasks and Teams/Agents.
# - No new classes/properties were added (per instructions). Where needed, rich textual literals (dc:description, Prompt properties) are used to preserve omitted semantics.
